<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br />


<div id="q1" class="qHeader" onclick="collapeTextBox('q1')">Is this software free or does it cost money?</div>
<div class="answer">
    BeyondRGB is a free and open-source software. You can install and run BeyondRGB free of charge, 
    all that is needed is proper lighting equipment and a standard RGB camera.
</div>


<div id="q2" class="qHeader" onclick="collapeTextBox('q2')">Why is BeyondRGB taking so long to install? Why do I still see the installation gif?</div>
<div class="answer">
    BeyondRGB should not actually take too long to install onto your computer. Sometimes the installation gif will
    remain on screen even after the installation has completed. This is a known bug. 
    To check that BeyondRGB has finished installing TODO. Once it is finished you can right click on the icon on the taskbar
    and manually close the window, which sould get rid of the installation gif. 
</div>


<div id="q3" class="qHeader" onclick="collapeTextBox('q3')">Why is my Mac saying "Unidentified developer" before installation?</div>
<div class="answer">
    Mac computers have a built in safety system to prevent users from installing untrusted or malicious
    software. Applications that are "signed" are considered trustworthy by Mac, however signing
    an application requires money. <br />
    This goes against BeyondRGB's intent to be a free, open source software. Even though BeyondRGB is not signed, 
    it is still safe to install. See this video to learn how to bypass the warning.

<div id="q4" class="qHeader" onclick="collapeTextBox('q4')">Reccommended specs for batch processing?</div>
<div class="answer">
   todo
</div>

<div id="q5" class="qHeader" onclick="collapeTextBox('q5')">Where is my color managed image?</div>
<div class="answer">
    Your color managed image should appear in the folder that was selected during the "Output Destination" step during Processing.
    The color managed image will be a .TIFF file; the filename will begin with the prefix "BeyondRGB_CM_" followed by a string of numbers.
    <img class="faqImage" src="resources/cmImageFileLocation.png"/>
</div>

<div id="q6" class="qHeader" onclick="collapeTextBox('q6')">Sometimes the image viewers say "error not found", but will then load the image fine?</div>
<div class="answer">
    This is a known issue, it simply has to do with the way the image is loaded. 
    Unless a error alert popup appears, the image should load given a few seconds.
</div>

<div id="q7" class="qHeader" onclick="collapeTextBox('q7')">Why is BeyondRGB slowing down my computer?</div>
<div class="answer">
    This is expected. BeyondRGB uses a lot of your computers CPU because spectral processing an image is a computationally expensive process.
    We do not recommend trying to perform other tasks on your computer while BeyondRGB is processing an image. We also suggest closing other processes
    (search browsers, applications, etc.) while BeyondRGB is processing an image. Once the process is finished, your computer should return to its normal
    performance.

FAQ:

What lighting condition is used for the example images?



how many images can batch processing handle?
 reccommend a number, and how fast 

    


Reccommended specs for batch processing?
	its preferred if the computer running b-rgb is not doing anything else

What should I do if I run into an error?
	during processing?
	check output folder for what did not get processed

	
I moved my image(s) / file(s) into a differnet spot and now nothing will load?
	preferred to keep all files in the original destination directory.
	preffered to keep all files together as well.
	Go into .btrgb file and change the filepaths to the current filepaths.

    

Q: can you use anytype of camera with this?

Q: What lighting conditions is used for the example images?
A: (leah will provide information)


Q: Can you image 3d objects:
A: no

A: make sure they are lined up, not glossy, have registration targets

Q: can I use my own color calibration target
A: yes (provide details on how) -->
